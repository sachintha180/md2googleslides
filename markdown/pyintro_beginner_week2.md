## Data Types & Variables

---

# Lesson Objectives

1. Understand the concept of data types in Python.
2. Learn to create and assign variables in Python.
3. Practice storing different types of data in variables.
4. Use `print()` to display variable values dynamically.
5. Build a "Dream Vacation Profile" using variables.

# What are Data Types? Section 1 of 4

---

# Data Types Overview

- Data types define the kind of data a variable can hold in Python.
- Key types include:
  - **Integers**: Whole numbers (e.g., `10`, `-3`)
  - **Floats**: Decimal numbers (e.g., `4.5`, `-0.75`)
  - **Strings**: Text data, enclosed in quotes (e.g., `"Hello!"`)
  - **Booleans**: Logical values, either `True` or `False`

---

# Why Data Types Matter

- Knowing the data type helps Python determine how to handle the data.
- Different types support specific operations:
  - **Integers/Floats**: Useful for arithmetic operations.
  - **Strings**: Useful for storing and manipulating text.
  - **Booleans**: Useful for making decisions in programs.

```text
CONTAINS IMAGE OF ICONS REPRESENTING DIFFERENT DATA TYPES: INTEGER, FLOAT, STRING, BOOLEAN
```

# Quick Exercise 1 of 4 Identify the data type of the following: `"Hello"`, `42`, `3.14`, `False`

---

# Variables Section 2 of 4

---

# What is a Variable?

- A variable is a **container** for storing data values.
- It allows you to **reuse** information without retyping it.
- Create a variable by giving it a **name** and assigning it a **value**.
  - Example: `city = "Paris"`

---

# Naming Variables

- Variable names must:
  - Start with a **letter** or **underscore (_)**.
  - Avoid spaces or special symbols (use underscores instead).
  - Describe the stored data for clarity (e.g., `age`, `height`).

---

# Assigning New Values

- Variables are flexible and can be updated with new values.
  - Example: `city = "Paris"` can later be updated to `city = "London"`.
- Changing variable values dynamically helps create interactive programs.

---

# Quick Exercise 2 of 4 Create a variable called `favorite_food` and assign it your favorite food (e.g., `favorite_food = "Pizza"`).

---

# Using `print()` with Variables Section 3 of 4

---

# Displaying Variables with `print()`

- Use the `print()` function to display variable values:
  - `print(variable_name)` will output the variable’s value.
- You can combine text with variables in `print()`:
  - Example: `print("I love", favorite_food)`

---

# Combining Text and Variables

- Combine text and variable values for dynamic output:
  - `print("My name is", name, "and I am", age, "years old")`
- This method makes output more descriptive and engaging.

```text
CONTAINS IMAGE OF CODE SNIPPET WITH print("My name is", name, "and I am", age, "years old") DISPLAYED
```

---

# Updating and Printing Variables

- Try updating a variable and re-running the code to see the change.
- This demonstrates how variables allow programs to change dynamically.

---

# Quick Exercise 3 of 4 Create a variable called `pet_name` and print a sentence using it, like “My pet’s name is ___.”

---

# Using Variables in Calculations Section 4 of 4

---

# Variables as Numbers

- Variables can store numbers for arithmetic calculations:
  - Example: `length = 10`, `width = 5`
  - Calculation: `area = length * width`
- Use `print()` to display the result: `print("The area is:", area)`

---

# Arithmetic Operators

- Python supports basic math operations with variables:
  - **Addition**: `+`
  - **Subtraction**: `-`
  - **Multiplication**: `*`
  - **Division**: `/`
- Example: `total_cost = item_price * quantity`

---

# Quick Exercise 4 of 4 Create two variables, `num_apples` and `num_oranges`, and calculate the total fruit count using addition.

---

# Dream Vacation Profile Section 5 of 5

---

# Your Task: Create a Dream Vacation Profile

- Imagine your ideal vacation and create a profile using variables:
  - **Destination**: String for dream location.
  - **Days**: Integer for the number of days you’d stay.
  - **Activity**: String for an activity to do there.
  - **Budget**: Float for your budget in dollars.

---

# Displaying Your Vacation Profile

- Use `print()` statements to display each detail of your profile:
  - Example:
    - `print("Destination:", destination)`
    - `print("Days:", days)`
    - `print("Planned Activity:", activity)`
    - `print("Budget: $", budget)`

---

# Example Output: Dream Vacation Profile

- Example profile output:
  - **Destination**: Paris
  - **Days**: 7
  - **Activity**: Sightseeing
  - **Budget**: $1500.00

**Hint:** Remember to format the output for clarity.

Once completed, save and share your code as `<name>_2.py`.
