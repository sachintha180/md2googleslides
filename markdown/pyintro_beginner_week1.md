## Introduction to Python

---

# Lesson Objectives

1. Understand what programming is.
2. Learn about Python and the Thonny IDE.
3. Write and customize a basic “Hello, World!” program.
4. Experiment with `print()` and simple math operations on Python.
5. Program your own profile card on Python.

# Welcome to Programming Section 1 of 5

---

# What is programming?

- Programming is the process of **creating instructions** for a computer to perform tasks
- Computers follow **exact instructions** provided by a programming language like Python
- When given a problem, we first **design algorithms** before **implementing programs**.

# Let’s make a good cup of tea!

1. Boil **half a kettle** of water
2. Add **1 tablespoon of** tea leaves **to a teacup**
3. Add boiling water to the teacup
4. Add **1 teaspoon of** sugar **to the teacup**
5. Stir **the contents until dissolved**
6. Drink **while hot** 

- Just like that, **algorithms** must be Precise, Repeatable and Finite

# Why Python?

- Python is known for its **simplicity**, making it a great choice for beginners.
- Python is used in real-world applications like **websites, games, data science, and even AI!**
- By learning Python, you’ll be able to **create your own programs** and bring ideas to life!

# Installing Thonny IDE

- Thonny is an **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)** for Python.
- It’s like a **special notebook** for writing and testing Python code.
- Thonny is beginner friendly and comes built in with Python.
- Download Thonny from [thonny.org](http://thonny.org) and follow the instructions to install it.

---

# Why Thonny?

```text
THIS SLIDE HAS NO BODY. CONTAINS SCREENSHOT OF THONNY WINDOW WITH THE LABELS (Tab bar, Command buttons, Current file, Code editor, Shell) WITH IMAGE OF SNAIL SHELL DIRECTED AT THE "Shell" LABEL
```

---

# Re. Why Thonny?

- Thonny is **beginner-friendly** and helps spot mistakes easily.
- It has a **simple layout** with a place to write code, view errors, and see results all in one window.

---

# Quick Exercise 2 of 4 Create and save a new Python File called “`my_first_program.py`” using Thonny

---

# Writing Your First Python Program Section 3 of 5

---

# What is “`Hello, World!`”?

- Writing “Hello, World!” is a **traditional first program** in any language, meant to introduce **basic syntax**.
- This Python program uses a function called `print()` to display text on the screen.

---

# Writing your first code

- In the file your created, type the following code into Thonny’s editor:
- The `print()` function tells Python to **display any message** you include inside the **quotation marks**.

```text
CONTAINS IMAGE OF THONNY CODE EDITOR WITH "print("Hello, World")" TYPED IN, IN A SAVED FILE NAMED "my_first_program.py"
```

---

# Running your first code

- After writing the code, **press the “Save” button**
- After that, **click the “Run” button** (or press F5)
- This should **run your code**. You will see your name in the Shell.
- **Congratulations** - You’ve just run your first Python program!

# Quick Exercise 3 of 4 Update the program to output your name instead

---

# Basic Math in Python Section 4 of 5

---

# Python as a Calculator

- Python can do basic math directly within the `print()` command.
- Here are some examples to try:
  - Addition \
    `print(5 + 3)` will display `8`
  - Subtraction \
    `print(10 - 2)` will display `8`

---

# Re. Python as a Calculator


- Here are some more examples to try:
  - Multiplication \
    `print(4 * 2)` will display `8`
  - Division \
    `print(16 / 2)` will display `8.0`

- Understanding math operations in Python will help you build more interactive and dynamic programs.

---

# Expanding on the `print()` command

- You can also output more than one message using `print()`:
- In the above example, you should see the following in the Shell:
`“Hello, I am 15 years old.”`
- In the above example, the **comma combines** the different messages together and **adds space between them**.

```text
CONTAINS IMAGE OF THONNY CODE EDITOR WITH "print("Hello, I am", 5 * 3, "years old.")", IN AN UNSAVED FILE NAMED "my_first_program.py"
```

---

# Quick Exercise 4 of 4 Write a program that outputs your name and your age in one line, without mentioning your age as it is.

---

# Create a Profile Card Section 5 of 5

---

# Your task: Create a profile card

- Write a program on Python to output the following using print():
  - Name with a greeting (“Hi”)
  - A simple calculation and answer.
  - Your favorite subject.

- Each output should be on one line each.

---

# Example: My profile card

- Here’s what my program’s output looks like:
- **Hint:** You should use a comma on your 3<sup>rd</sup> print statement.
- Once completed, save and share your code as `<name>_1.py`

```text
CONTAINS IMAGE OF THONNY SHELL OUTPUT WITH AN EXAMPLE PROFILE CARD:
Hi, I'm Sachintha
> I'm 21 years old
> 5 + 5 is 10
> My favorite subject is Computer Science
```
